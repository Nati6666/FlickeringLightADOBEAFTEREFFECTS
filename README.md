 Flickering Light Effect in Adobe After Effects

## Description
This project demonstrates how to create a flickering light effect using Adobe After Effects. The flickering light effect can be used in various motion graphics and visual effects projects, simulating realistic lighting changes or creating dramatic effects.

## Features
- **Random Flickering**: The light's intensity randomly fluctuates over time.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust the frequency, intensity, and timing of the flicker.
- **Plug-in Free**: Uses only native tools and expressions in After Effects, without the need for third-party plugins.

## Prerequisites
- Adobe After Effects (any version supporting expressions).
- Basic knowledge of After Effects' keyframing and expressions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flickering-light.git
2. Open the After Effects project
Once cloned, navigate to the project folder and open the .aep project file in Adobe After Effects.

3. Customize the effect
You can adjust the following properties in the project file:

Light Layer: Modify the light's intensity and flickering pattern.

Expression Controls: Fine-tune the flicker speed and randomness.

How it Works
The flickering light effect is created by using expressions on a light's intensity property. These expressions generate random values based on time, simulating the flicker.

### 3. **Save and Commit the README**
Once you have written your README:

1. Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section in GitHub.
2. Write a commit message like "Add README for flickering light project."
3. Click "Commit changes."

### 4. **Make It More Interactive (Optional)**
You can also add visuals like GIFs or images to show the result of the flickering light effect. To do this, upload your images or GIFs to the repository and reference them in your README.

For example:

```markdown
![Flickering Light Effect](path/to/flickering-light.gif)
This will display a GIF of the flickering light effect directly in the README.
